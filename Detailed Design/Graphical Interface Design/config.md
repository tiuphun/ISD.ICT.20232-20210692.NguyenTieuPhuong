# Screen Configuration
For more details, please refer to the Components page at my [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/NCLPYWvx5sdVtl7og0pTmI/AIMS?type=design&node-id=13%3A3&mode=design&t=18TjJWkoltEKWcLo-1).

## Display
Number of colors supported: 16,777,216 colors
Resolution: 1366 Ã— 768
Color profile: sRGB

## Screen
Location of standard buttons: At the bottom (vertically) and in the middle (horizontally) of the frame
Location of the messages: Starting from the top vertically and in the middle horizontally of the frame down to the bottom.
Display of the screen title: The title is located at the top of the frame in the middle (for Home). Progress strip for the checkout process will span left to right.
Consistency in expression of alphanumeric numbers: comma for separator of thousand while strings only consist of characters, digits, commas, dots, spaces, underscores, and hyphen symbol.

## Control
Size of the text: medium size (mostly 20px). Font: Montserrat Semi Bold. Color: #000000
Input check process: Should check if it is empty or not. Next, check if the input is in the correct format or not.
Sequence of moving the focus: There will be no stack frames. Each screen will be separated. However, the manual is considered a popup message, as the main screen cannot be operated while the manual screen is shown. After the opening screen, the app will start with splash screen, and then the first screen (home screen) will appear.


## Direct input from the keyboard
There will be no shortcuts. There are back buttons to move back to the previous screen. Also, there is the close button "X" located at the title bar to the right to close the screen.

## Error
A message will be given to notify the users what is the problem.
